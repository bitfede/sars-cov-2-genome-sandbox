# Reverse Engineering Coronavirus with Python

## Intro

Can computer programming and medicine come together to form a powerful synergy? Absolutely!

This article wants to show how the Python programming language can be used to perform various tasks on biological data and most importantly to automate a simple workflow. Automating tasks saves time to doctors and researchers, and lets them digest more data for better insights.

Specifically I will approach the sars-cov-2 virus as if it was a computer virus, and I'll attempt to reverse engineer it by analyzing its components and understanding its modus operandi.

I am not a trained and professional scientist, meaning I do not have an MD or a PhD in life sciences, so please if anything is inaccurate leave a comment below.

This article is meant to be read by everyone, I will keep concepts simple and explain everything so even if you do not have a background in biology you can follow along and learn some interesting things.

## Our Specimen

In order to get started we need a specimen to analyze, if this was a computer virus I would find it in some malware database website like https://thezoo.morirt.com/, but here we are dealing with a human virus, so I headed to https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ and searched for "sars-cov-2".

I immediately found the full genome of the virus, which interestingly enough had a lot of samples available:

I picked the MN908947 one, which was the first sample taken in Wuhan in December 2019.

The specimen is located at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MN908947, but before getting my hands dirty lets brush up on knowledge and explain some background information.

## Viruses and Human Cells

Let's forget about COVID19 for a moment and start from the beginning, what is a virus?

A virus is not an organism or a living form, but an infectious entity that enters a human or animal host and hacks its internal machinery in order to replicate itself and spread even further. As an infected host come into contact with other organisms the virus can infect them too. Picture a virus like this:

How does this happen exactly? Animal cells have an organelle called Ribosome, and what the ribosome does is creating amino acids from a piece of mRNA (messenger RNA). So as a metaphor imagine the Ribosome as a car factory, mRNA is the instructions/blueprints and the amino acids produced are the final car parts. The amino acids created by the ribosome will then be assembled together in the cell and will form a protein, just like car parts form a car when they're assembled together.

As you can see the ribosome reads the mRNA string to produce a multitude of amino acids (called a peptide chain). These amino acids form proteins, and proteins are the building blocks of life because they perform all kinds of functions.

This is the exact place where the virus will take over and mess things up, but how? Well the ribosome is pretty dumb, meaning that it just synthesizes whatever it receives as mRNA without questioning anything. So what is it going to happen when a virus injects his own RNA string into the cell? The ribosomes will pick it up and immediately follow the instructions written in that piece of viral RNA, producing more copies of the proteins that make up that virus.

This way the virus basically takes over the cell protein factory and can now multiply itself vastly, infecting more cells and forcing more ribosomes to work for him. This will produce inflammation and other side effects, making people experience the symptoms of the particular virus that infected them. Some viruses can be eliminated by our immune system through the production of antibodies, other are harder to fight off.

This the basic simplified mechanism for viral infection and replication. I have been talking about "a virus" generically, but as you can imagine there are many many kinds of viruses. Just like organisms have a taxonomy and a classification viruses have their own classification. The systems for taxonomically classifying viruses are mainly two:

- The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) system
- The Baltimore classification system

## Analysis of specimen

So now that we know some useful background information about viruses and how they work, let's get back to our specimen and start learning more about it.

According to the ICTV system this virus belongs to the subfamily Orthocoronavirinae, in the family Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales, and realm Riboviria.

According to the Baltimore Classification system this virus is a (+)ssRNA (= positive-sense single-stranded RNA) virus.

Having a positive polarity of RNA means that the virus can serve directly its genetic information as mRNA to the ribosome and get it translated into amino acids without having to transcribe it or any kind of preprocessing. This means it is very infectious, and many "famous" viruses belong to this family: hepatitis C, west nile virus, dengue virus, SARS, MERS, common cold virus, rhinoviruses, and many more.

This means that the genome at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MN908947 can be transcribed immediately into RNA and translated into proteins. But before doing that let's write the code that will read the whole viral genome and store it in a variable.

As a first step I'll go to my terminal and download the FASTA format of the genome. FASTA is a file format widely used in bioinformatics to represent a sequence of nucleotides or amino acids. Since we're dealing with a viral genome the file will contain a sequence of nucleotides.

So I copied the content of the fasta data here (url)https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MN908947.3?report=fasta&log$=seqview&format=text into a local file and called it 

Now that I have the genome file in my local folder let's finally start writing the python program:
